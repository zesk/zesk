## [v0.31.2][]

- Reversed `CHANGELOG.md` generation so it's latest release first in the file
- Added a warning to `CHANGELOG.md` to prevent editing errors later
- Added explicit `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` export to `bin/pipeline-setup.sh`
- Removed references to the `share` directory in the documentation. (deprecated)
- Replaced all references to `application.inc` to `application.php` in code and documentation.
- Fixed `zesk` binary to parse arguments and use `--cd` and `--search` to find the Zesk application before running PHP
- `composer validate` now passes and is part of the build step
- 1.0 modules plan in release notes
