## [v0.31.0][]

Major revamp of Zesk. PSR-4. PHP 8.1. Added typing to most calls.

We anticipate a few small releases before a full 1.0 release.

Many breaking changes:

- `zesk\Options` and `zesk\Configuration` keys are case-sensitive
- `zesk\Exception\KeyNotFound` is used in cases where the key should exist more often
- `zesk\Exception` naming refactored
- Doctrine added, `zesk\Database` and `zesk\ORM` were removed. LOL.
- Module names are case-sensitive
- Module JSONs are now loaded via glob `*.module.json` to avoid case-sensitivity issues
- All modules restructured to new project layout, tests added
- `Net` module had major renaming, part-way finished (WIP)
- Removed all widget and most HTML-related tools - moving to a more API-centric server model.
- Deprecated: `avalue`, `zesk\Kernel`
- All namespaces for modules are now `zesk\ModuleName\ClassName`
- Using flatter namespaces for most references
- Major camelCase refactor and cleanup
- PHP 8.1 default
- Template paths are no longer case-insensitive
- Code coverage for testing is more than 50%
- Added docker and testing containers
- Support XDEBUG debugging from the container
- Major development, build, and release updates to the project in `docker`, `bin/build`
- Removed a ton of old code and things which were no longer used
- Exceptions were renamed and refactored, now all have an `Exception` suffix
- Better use of namespaces
- World Bootstrap moved into `zesk\World\Bootstrap`
- Hook system rewritten to use PHP `Attribute`s
- Case-sensitivity has generally been removed from most systems where it was unnecessary
