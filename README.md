# Zesk

**Zesk Application Framework**: All the good stuff, none of the bad.

**Zesk is a suite of tools which make writing web applications easy and fast.** A robust and feature-rich **Object Relational Mapping** interface, **database schema synchronization**, easy command line tool coding, and tons of tools to allow you to write web applications quickly. 

It also has a modular interface to all extension via modules, a powerful hook system to allow integration and notifications for events, and an object-oriented architecture to allow for fast development using subclasses.

It also has a Model-View-Controller architecture, and a form and object editing system using Controls and Views (for form elements and UI generation).

Zesk is a toolkit and a platform, and attempts to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. In addition, it generates no errors, warnings, or notices within the code, and encourages applications to be written using all and strict error reporting. It also attempts to avoid many of the PHP language inconsistencies.

Module integration is meant to be straightforward, seamless, and easy to manage.

## History 

Zesk was written primarily by [Market Acumen, Inc.](https://marketacumen.com/?crsource=zesk-readme) and has been in use in commercial products since 2003.

Zesk has been refactored a few times and the good ideas were taken out of the original (Database schema, MVC) and improved. Inspired over the years by CodeIgniter, Kohana, Zend Framework, Drupal, Wordpress, Laravel, and Symfony.

With the advent of PHP Standards, we've adopted PSR-4 and some other naming standards in the core APIs, including `Psr/Log` and `Psr/Cache`.

Strict PHP 8 support is planned for 2022 and migration to PHPUnit for all testing and coverage as well as docker testing built-in.
