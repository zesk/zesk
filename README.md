# Zesk

**Zesk Application Framework**: One-button PHP Cloud, Big Data, and Secure Web Applications.

**Zesk is a suite of tools which make writing web applications easy and fast.** Levering Doctrine's **Object Relational Mapping**  and Database interfaces, easy command line tool coding, and tons of tools to allow you to write web applications quickly.

It also has a modular interface to all extension via modules, a powerful hook system to allow integration and notifications for events, and an object-oriented architecture to allow for fast development using subclasses.

Strict PHP 8.1 support is planned for 2023 and migration to PHPUnit for all testing and coverage as well as docker testing built-in.

## History

Zesk was written primarily by [Market Acumen, Inc.](https://marketacumen.com/?crsource=zesk-readme) and has been in use in commercial products since 2002 and written originally in PHP 4.

Zesk has been refactored a few times and the good ideas were taken out of the original and improved. Inspired over the years by CodeIgniter, Kohana, Zend Framework, Drupal, Wordpress, Laravel, and Symfony, in addition to the work of many talented developers, including [Fabian Potencier](http://fabien.potencier.org/). Currently use [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/) for the unerlying database and ORM framework.
