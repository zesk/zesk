?>Your system does not have the {command} utility in the path {path}. To fix:

1. Check that it is installed
2. Update your shell PATH to include where the {command} exists in your file system, or
3. Update the global "commmand_path" by editing the [configuration file](http://zesk.com/command-path) or upon your application startup
