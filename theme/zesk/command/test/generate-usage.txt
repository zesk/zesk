Generate Zesk unit tests from PHP source files automatically that can be run using the zesk test framework.
	
Creates a directory "test" beneath any found file with extension:
	
    .php .inc
	
And adds functions tests as
	
    filename_test.inc
	
And adds class tests as:
	
    class_name_test.inc
	
Static functions within a class are added as their own file as:
	
    Class_Name-static_function_name.phpt
	
A basic shell of a test is added, it is expected that use cases are added to the tests.
	
Tests differ from the PEAR testing strategy in that tests are run from the command line. Non-zero exit status indicates failure.
