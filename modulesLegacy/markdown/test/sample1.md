# Here's some markdown

## Introduction

Once upon a time, I wrote some documentation.
`Code` Looks like this.

- List?
- We can write this as many ways as we want, but here's the main thing.

This is a distinct list:

1. Thing
2. Things
3. Things

[Links][] should appear like links.

### Everything else is just poop

You should try to write code like this:

    This is quoted code

> This is blockquoted stuff It doesn't really mean it's in here. But I can add to it, and as I keep writing, it looks pretty good.

I really like Markdown as a programmer. It's easy to write good looking docs with little or no effort.
